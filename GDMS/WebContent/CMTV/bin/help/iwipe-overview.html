    <h1>ISYS: Web Integration</h1> 
    
    <p>ISYS's Web Integration feature enables the integration of web sites
    with the ISYS platform. At a minimum, any web site loaded by ISYS will
    allow DynamicDiscovery to be performed on any of its text. Additionally,
    specific web sites will be treated as first-class ISYS components, which
    will be referred to as "web components". Web components will interact with
    a given web site in order to present the user with explicit ranges of text
    upon which DynamicDiscovery can be performed.</p>
