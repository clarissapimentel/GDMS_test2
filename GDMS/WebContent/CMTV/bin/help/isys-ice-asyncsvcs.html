    <h1>ISYS: Asynchronous Services</h1>

    <p>Some ISYS components may provide services that can potentially take a
    long time to execute. In order to allow the user to continue working while
    the service executes, a component can opt to execute the service in the
    background. Such a service is termed an asynchronous service (please
    forgive our software-centric terminology here). When an asynchronous
    service is executed, the user will be immediately returned to the
    component from which she invoked the asynchronous service. When the
    service has completed its execution, the result will either be displayed
    in the invoking component's graphical user interface or a new window or
    component will be opened (the specific behavior depends upon the nature of
    the service, of course).</p>

    <p>The user can track the progress of asynchronous services in ISYS's main
    window. The bottom portion of the window lists all asynchronous services
    that have been invoked, showing various statistics including the service's
    name, its status (whether it is active or has completed, for instance),
    the time at which it was invoked, the elapsed time, and the completion
    time (if applicable). Via the provided buttons, the user may also cancel
    active services (in case she is no longer interested in the result) and
    clear all services that are no longer active.</p>
