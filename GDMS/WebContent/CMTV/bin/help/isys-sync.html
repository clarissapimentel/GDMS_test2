    <h1>ISYS: Synchronization</h1>

    <p>Two components may become synchronized with each other when one
    component spawns another via <a href="isys-dyndisc.html">Dynamic
    Discovery</a>. When components are synchronized they will respond to
    various changes in their partner's graphical user interface. ISYS supports
    the following types of synchronization:</p>
    <table border=1 cellpadding=4>
        <tr>
          <td>Selection</td> <td>Items selected or deselected in one component
          will cause associated items to be selected or deselected in the
          other component. This type of synchronization can be used to view
          equivalency relationships between data sets.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Visibility</td> <td>Items shown or hidden in one component will
          cause associated items to be shown or hidden in the other
          component. This type of synchronization can effectively allow one
          component to act as a filtering mechanism for the other component.
            </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Membership</td> <td>Items added or removed in one component will
          cause associated items to be added or removed in the other
          component. This type of synchronization can be used to
          simultaneously build (or prune) the data sets of both
          components.</td>
        </tr>
    </table>
          
    <p>The specific effect that one component has on another is determined in
    part by how the "receiving" component maps the "sending" component's data
    to its own data. The nature of this mapping can produce either obvious or
    non-obvious relationships between the data sets. The receiving component
    will attempt to do the "right thing" but is ultimately limited by the nature
    of the data in the two components. It is entirely possible that the
    receiving component cannot deduce a useful mapping between the two data
    sets, in which case no synchronous behavior will be observed. Also note
    that these mappings can produce both one-to-many and many-to-one
    relationships among items in the two data sets.</p>
