    <h1>ISYS: DynamicDiscovery <font size=-2>(TM)</font></h1>

    <p>DynamicDiscovery is a feature of ISYS that allows data in one
    component to be passed on to another component for further analysis or
    visualization. This feature works by allowing the user to view a list of
    services that can operate on the currently selected data items in the
    active component. The user can then select (invoke) one of the available
    services, thereby sending the selected data off to another component for
    further analysis or visualization. The set of services that are listed is
    determined by the nature of the selected data. For example, if
    DynamicDiscovery is performed on a vector of sequences the returned
    services will be those that are able to process sequence data.</p>

    <p>While the method for using this feature can vary somewhat from
    component to component, the general usage pattern is the same. To perform
    DynamicDiscovery, first select the data items upon which a new operation
    will be performed. For instance, if component presents its data in a
    table, select the desired rows. Next, place the mouse cursor over the
    selected data (or any one of the selected items if they are, for instance,
    discontiguous) and click the right-mouse button. This will cause a popup
    menu to appear that lists all services that can be invoked on the selected
    data. Simply click on one of these services to invoke it. At this point,
    one of two things may occur. The selected service may open a new graphical
    user interface, in which case the selected data will be displayed in some
    new manner (note that what is displayed may be the <i>result</i> of some
    intermediate analysis operation). Alternatively, the selected service may
    simply perform some analysis operation which returns only data. In this
    case the user will then be shown a dialog box that wil prompt her to
    select an appropriate service that can be used to view the result.</p>

    <p>Note that the list of services generated by DynamicDiscovery will be
    determined by the set of components that is currently installed (and
    active) in your ISYS installation. Also note that it is entirely possible
    that no services will be returned. Finally, be aware that the popup menu
    may also display menu options that are native to the component (that is,
    options that would normally be displayed in response to a right mouse
    click even in the absence of the ISYS platform).</p>

    <p>Once a new component has been opened via DynamicDiscovery, it will
    often be synchronized with the component from which it was opened. See the
    <a href="isys-sync.html">Synchronization</a> section for details.</p>
