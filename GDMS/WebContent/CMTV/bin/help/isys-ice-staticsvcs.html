    <h1>ISYS: Static Services</h1>

    <p>Static services are services that a component depends upon to function
    properly. Static services allow components to share their functionality
    with one another, thereby eliminating "duplication of effort". Some
    components will provide static services, while other components will make
    use of these services (some components may do both).</p>

    <p>From the user's perspective, the most significant aspect of static
    services is that they introduce a level of configurability into the ISYS
    platform. A component that relies upon a specific type of static service
    can in fact be supplied that service by any other component (including
    itself). If more than one component supplies the required static service,
    the user is allowed to choose which implementation will be used. This
    configuration is done via the "File | Configure..." menu option in the
    ISYS main window. On the Services tab of the "ISYS Configuration" dialog
    box, the user will be shown a list of every static service that is
    required by at least one component. Each of these required static services
    is mapped to an specific implementation (the mapping is denoted by the
    "->" arrow), which is provided by a particular component. The user can
    change any of these mappings by selecting the desired row and clicking the
    "Map..."  button. The user can then select an alternative implementation
    that is to be used. All components that require a given static service
    will be made to use the selected implementation.</p>

    <p>For example, in the default configuration of ISYS there exists at least
    one component that relies upon having available a similarity search
    service, which happens to be named "SimSearchSvc". Two other
    components--the Remote Sequence Similarity Search component and the Local
    Sequence Similarity Search component--provide implementations of this
    static service. Using the ISYS Configuration dialog box, the user can
    select whether the "RemoteNcbiBlastSvc" or the (local) "NcbiBlastSvc"
    implementation is to be used, which will determine whether BLAST searches
    are performed by a remote server or the local, host computer. (Please note
    that the "NcbiBlastSvc" service will only be available if the user has
    installed BLAST on her own computer and properly configured the
    Components/simsearch/simsearch.prop file.) </p>
