    <h1>Web Integration: Limitations</h1>
    Please note the following limitations of the Web Integration feature:
    <ul>
      <li>Only Netscape Navigator 4.x or higher and Internet Explorer 5.x and higher are supported.</li>
      <li>No cookie support. Web sites that require the use of cookies may
        fail or not function as expected.</li>
      <li>ISYS may not be able to properly modify some web sites which may
        allow some hyperlinks to be retrieved directly from a remote web
        server, rather than through the ISYS HTTP proxy. If this happens, the
        returned web page (and all subsequent pages) will not exhibit ISYS
        integrated behavior. If the page's URL does not start with
        "http://localhost:8080" (the port may be different for your
        installation), then the web page will not be integrated.</li>
      <li>Web pages will only exhibit integrated behavior when ISYS is
        running.</li>
      <li>No support for https (Secure HTTP) or any other protocols (ftp,
        etc.) besides HTTP. If you navigate to a URL that uses a protocol
        other than HTTP, the requested web page (and all subsequent web pages)
        will not exhibit ISYS integrated behavior.</li>
      <li>The ISYS HTTP proxy does not support the retrieval of compressed
        HTML pages. This may result is slightly slower response times.</li>
      <li>Web pages that refresh or redirect themselves with the META tag's
        HTTP-EQUIV="Refresh" attribute will not work for web pages loaded via
        ISYS.</li>
      <li>Internet Explorer does not work well on UNIX environments; subsequent 
        iexplorer processes will not display new browser windows and there is
        no apparent way of requesting an existing iexplorer process to open a
        new window. If you have information regarding this limitation please
        contact isys@ncgr.org.</li>
    </ul>
