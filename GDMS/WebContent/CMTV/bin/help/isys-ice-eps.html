    <h1>ISYS: Opening Components</h1>

    <p>ISYS's main window allows the user to open any component's graphical
    user interface that can be used as a starting point for an ISYS
    session. These components provide "entry point services" that open the
    component when executed. All entry point services are displayed as buttons
    in the main window and are accompanied by descriptive text that identifies
    their function. To open a given component, simply click on that
    component's entry point service button. These entry point services can
    also be invoked from the Services menu, if desired.</p>

    <p>Once a component is in use, it is generally possible to navigate to
    other components that operate on the active component's data. See the next
    section, <a href="isys-dyndisc.html">DynamicDiscovery</a>, to learn how this
    works.</p>
