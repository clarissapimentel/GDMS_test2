    <h1>Web Integration: Components</h1>
    Currently, ISYS provides a few specially customized web components: 

    <h2>GENSCAN (http://genes.mit.edu/GENSCAN.html)</h2>

    <p>Provides a service for the identification of complete gene structures
    in genomic DNA. You can use the GENSCAN web component by invoking the
    GENSCAN entry point service in the main window. The GENSCAN web component
    can also be dynamically discovered from sequence text (e.g., from the
    Sequence Viewer component). When dynamically discovered, the query page
    will be opened, with the sequence text area filled in. When the query is
    executed, the result page will be displayed (assuming an email address for
    results was not specified). Predicted nucleotide and peptide sequences
    will be dynamically discoverable. Additionally, the predicted genes/exons
    will be sent to any component that spawned the GENSCAN web component via
    dynamic discovery (to see this in action, dynamically discover the GENSCAN
    web component from Sequence Viewer and watch how predicted genes/exons are
    displayed in the Sequence Viewer window).</p>

<h2>Entrez (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi)</h2>
  Allows complex querying of NCBI databases (including nucleotide and protein
  sequences, MEDLINE bibliographic information, and others) using the Entrez
  search system. You can use the Entrez web component by invoking the Entrez 
  entry point service in the main window. The Entrez web component can also be
  dynamically discovered from IsysAttribute types that have been mapped to
  Entrez search fields (currently, the only such mappings are for the GeneSymbol
  and ECNumber attributes). In this case, it will seed the Entrez query form's term 
  input with the values of the attributes, mapped to their appropriate fields.
  It will also appear as a dynamically discovered service for any text 
  selected in a web page, simply using this to seed the Entrez query form's
  term input without mapping it to a specific field. Neither of these 
  queries will be auto-submitted, allowing the user the opportunity to select
  the appropriate target database, and to further customize the query, if
  desired. 
<p>  
  When an Entrez query has been executed, the result page will be displayed,
  and the following items will be made dynamically discoverable:
<ul>  	
		<li>hyperlinked NCBI sequence identifiers</li>
		<li>"/gene" qualifiers in flatfile entries</li>
		<li>"/EC_number" qualifiers in flatfile entries</li>
</ul>
<p>
  In addition, the end of each flatfile entry will have a button that allows
  all the objects that have been parsed from the entry to be used as the subject
  of dynamic discovery.

<h2>Google (http://www.google.com)</h2>
  A general-purpose web search engine. The Google web component will appear as
  a dynamically discoverable service for any text selected in a web page. When
  the Google service is executed, a search will be performed on the selected
  text and a browser window will be opened that displays the results of the
  search.

<h2>FlyBase (http://flybase.bio.indiana.edu)<br>
MGI (http://www.informatics.jax.org)<br>
SGD (http://genome-www.stanford.edu)</h2>

Simple wrappers for the websites of various members of the GeneOntology
consortium.  Currently, the only way to access these sites directly from
another regular ISYS component (i.e. non-web components) is via the
GeneOntology browser.  If a single gene is right-mouse-clicked in the Gene
Products Results Frame, you will see the option to go to the web page of the
source database for information on that gene. This will invoke a web browser
and direct it to a page with detailed information on that gene. These pages
have been wrapped so that information that maps to IsysAttributes
(e.g. GeneSymbol, ORFName, various sequence Identifiers) will be put into a
single IsysObject with a single dynamic discovery target on the page. In
addition, these sites have search forms that allow you to look for sets of
genes matching given criteria. The results pages for these searches are
wrapped so that each row in the result set is treated as an individual object,
and the entire collection of objects is made available as the dynamic service
target, near the top of the results table.
