    <h1>ISYS Overview</h1>

    <p>ISYS (short for Integrated System) is a software platform that allows
    bioinformatics software tools ("components") to be used in an integrated
    fashion.</p>
      
    <p>ISYS allows the user to intuitively navigate between components by
    seamlessly sending data produced by one component to another. The user
    does not have to concern herself with how the data transfer occurs.</p>

    <p>ISYS also enables components to visually synchronize their
    behavior. When the user causes data to be selected, filtered, or generated
    in a component, other, related components will reflect these changes in an
    appropriate manner. In this way, components can be used together in
    complementary ways that provide behavior that neither component can
    exhibit on its own.</p>

    <p>ISYS supports two types of components: graphical user interfaces, which
    are used to visualize and manipulate data, and data-centric components,
    which provide data analysis, retrieval, and storage services. A graphical
    user interface that is provided by a component is also referred to as a
    "client".</p>

    <p>The concept of "services" is central to ISYS. A service is simply a
    unit of functionality that performs a single task. All of ISYS's useful
    functionality is provided via services, which are in turn provided by the
    components. The user must be aware of services in that an ISYS session
    commonly involves the selection and invocation of services to accomplish a
    goal. Services will be discussed further in later sections.

    <p>To use ISYS effectively, you will need to be familiar with its main
    features:<p>
