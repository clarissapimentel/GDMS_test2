    <h1>Web Integration: Configuration</h1>
    <p>All configuration options can be viewed and modified from the "Web" tab in 
    the ISYS Configuration dialog. To open this dialog, select "File", the
    "Configure..." from the ISYS main window.</p>

    <p>Before attempting to use any web component, you must configure the
    browser that ISYS will use (ISYS will remind you the first time you
    attempt to use a web component). In the "Web Browser" section, either type
    in the path to your browser executable or click the "Browse..." button to
    locate it. The "Arguments" field can be used to pass any special arguments
    that may be needed to start your browser. The special string "$url" can be
    used to tell ISYS where to include the URL of the web page that is to be
    opened.</p>

    <p>The "Port" field, under the "Web Proxy" section can be used to configure
    the port upon which ISYS's web proxy will be installed. You should only
    need to change this value if you have another program or process that is
    using the default port (8080). If you change the port, click the "Restart" 
    button.</p>

    <p>The "Network Proxy" section allows you to specify the host and port of
    an HTTP proxy that may be installed on your local network. If you normally
    have to specify proxy settings in your web browser, then you will have to
    specify those same settings here. Contact your network administrator if
    you are not sure whether a network proxy is being used on your
    network. <i>You will also have to configure your web browser such that it
    avoids using your network's HTTP proxy for "localhost" URLs</i> (i.e.,
    URLs that start with "http://localhost/"). Both Internet Explorer and
    Netscape Navigator allow you to specify a list of domains that will not be
    requested via the proxy. You will need to add "localhost" to this
    list. Contact your network administrator if you are not sure how to make
    these changes.</p>

    <p>The "DynamicDiscovery" section allows you to configure the color used
    for DynamicDiscovery hyperlinks and the modifier keys that are used to
    perform DynamicDiscovery in your web browser. The color can be modified
    simply by clicking the "Choose..." button and then using the resultant
    dialog to select a color. For the modifier keys, any combination of keys
    can be selected. These are the keys that must be held down while clicking
    a DynamicDiscovery hyperlink in your browser, if you want DynamicDiscovery
    to be performed. "Ctrl" works best for Netscape Navigator, while "Alt" is
    a good choice for Windows Explorer.</p>
