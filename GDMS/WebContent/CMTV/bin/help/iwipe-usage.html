    <h1>Web Integration: Usage</h1> 

    <p>Before using a web component, you should configure ISYS's web
    integration feature. See <a href="iwipe-config.html">Configuration</a> for
    detailed information.</p>

    <p>To load a web site through ISYS, click on the "Web Launcher" entry
    point service. You will be prompted to enter the URL of the web site you
    wish to use. Upon clicking the OK button, a browser will be opened that
    will display the requested URL (if this is the first time you're using a
    web component, ISYS will ask you to configure the browser to be used to
    open the web site). Use the web site to perform your task as
    usual. Presumably, you will eventually encounter some textual data that
    can be used as the target of DynamicDiscovery. For example, you may be
    presented with a nucleotide sequence. While holding down the appropriate
    DynamicDiscovery key(s) (which is user-configurable), use your mouse to
    select the target text. Upon release of your mouse button, you will be
    presented with a dialog box showing dynamically discovered services.</p>

    <p>Note that some (or even all) of the services displayed may or may not
    be appropriate for the selected text. ISYS components will do their best
    to interpret the type of data that is represented by the selected text
    when determining which services to display.  However, some components may
    not be able to decide whether the text is appropriate for their services
    and will instead allow the user to make this decision. Therefore, you must
    use your judgment when selecting a service.</p>

    <p>Further note that some of the available services may themselves be
    provided by web components. Thus, it is possible that selecting a service
    will open another browser window within your ISYS session. From the user's
    viewpoint, ISYS does not explicitly differentiate between normal
    components and web components.</p>

    <p>While the Web Launcher entry point service provides a convenient
    mechanism for opening web sites from ISYS, it is also possible to type a
    URL directly into your browser window. However, to allow the requested web
    site to be integrated with ISYS, the URL must be entered in a slightly
    modified fashion: type "http://localhost:8080/" followed by the normal
    URL. For example to load MIT's GENSCAN web site, you would type
    "http://localhost:8080/http://genes.mit.edu/GENSCAN.html". If you changed
    the port that ISYS uses for its web integration feature, type your
    configured port number instead of "8080" (see <a
    href="iwipe-config.html">Configuration</a>).</p>

    <p>Web sites that are explicitly managed by ISYS web components will
    usually have a corresponding entry point service in the main window. When
    one of these web sites is loaded you will (at some point) be presented
    with special hyperlinks that can be clicked on to perform
    DynamicDiscovery. By default, these dynamically discoverable hyperlinks
    are displayed as text on a tan background (this color can be configured;
    see <a href="iwipe-config.html">Configuration</a>). To invoke
    DynamicDiscovery on one of these special hyperlinks simply hold down the
    appropriate DynamicDiscovery key(s) when you click the link.</p>

    <p>Note that the hyperlink may also represent a "normal" hyperlink. To
    navigate to the URL normally associated with this hyperlink simply click
    the link without holding down the DynamicDiscovery key(s). Dynamically
    discoverable hyperlinks that are not also "normal" hyperlinks will not be
    underlined.</p>
